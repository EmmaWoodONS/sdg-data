  [Key Biodiversity Area](https://biodiversitya-z.org/content/important-plant-areas-ipa) - Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs) include 1) [Important Plant Areas](https://biodiversitya-z.org/content/important-plant-areas-ipa), which are natural or semi-natural sites that 'exhibit exceptional
  botanical richness and/or support an outstanding assemblage of rare, threatened and/or endemic plant species and/or vegetation of high botanic value', 2) [Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas (IBAs)](https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=c38f60f68f094f269d90db26b1381837), which are
  'selected on the basis of the bird numbers and species complements they hold. IBAs are particularly important for species that congregate in large numbers, such as wintering and passage waterbirds and breeding seabirds. Many sites have also been identified for species of global, and
  European/EU conservation concern.', and 3) Alliance for Zero Extinction sites, which contain '95% or more of the remaining population of one or more species listed as endangered or critically endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species' of which there are no UK sites.
  Protected area - protected areas include Nature Reserves, National Parks, Areas of Outsatnding Natural Beauty (AONB), Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), Heritage Coast, and National Scenic Areas. For the full list of designations please see [Protected
  Planet](https://www.protectedplanet.net/country/GBR). Protected areas are taken from the World Database of Protected Areas (WDPA). Note that the data presented here do not include any Marine Protected Areas (MPAs).  
  Ecosystem type - Ecosystem type is determined using the Centre for
  Ecology and Hydrology's 2015 [Land Cover Map (LCM2015)](https://www.ceh.ac.uk/services/land-cover-map-2015). This uses satellite data to categorise land into land cover classes, which are further aggregated to 'aggregate classes', here referred to as Ecosystem type. Land cover classes
  are described in the [JNCC Report 307](https://data.jncc.gov.uk/data/0b7943ea-2eee-47a9-bd13-76d1d66d471f/JNCC-Report-307-SCAN-WEB.pdf) and in the [Land Cover Map 2015 Documentation (PDF)](href="https://www.ceh.ac.uk/sites/default/files/LCM2015_Dataset_Documentation.pdf).  
    
  The
  follwing definitions give the broad habitats included in each Ecosystem type, with notes in brackets. Where no definition is given, the boad habitat name is the same as the ecosystem type -  
  Arable - 'Arable and Horticulture'  
  Broadleaf woodland - 'Broadleaved, Mixed and Yew
  Woodland'  
  Coastal - 'Supra-littoral Rock', 'Littoral Rock' and 'Littoral Sediment' (including saltmarsh)  
  Mountain, heath, bog - 'Dwarf Shrub Heath' (including heather and heather grassland), 'Bog', and 'Inland Rock'.  
  Semi-natural grassland - 'Neutral Grassland', 'Calcareous
  Grassland', 'Acid Grassland', and 'Fen, Marsh and Swamp'.

  Ecosystem type is determined using the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology's 2015 [Land Cover Map (LCM2015)](https://www.ceh.ac.uk/services/land-cover-map-2015). This uses satellite data to categorise land into land cover classes, which are based on the [Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) Broad
  Habitats](https://jncc.gov.uk/our-work/uk-bap-priority-habitats/). Land cover classes are further aggregated to 'aggregate classes', here referred to as Ecosystem type.  See definitions (above) for the land cover classes that are included in each ecosystem type. Land cover classes are
  described in the [JNCC Report 307](https://data.jncc.gov.uk/data/0b7943ea-2eee-47a9-bd13-76d1d66d471f/JNCC-Report-307-SCAN-WEB.pdf). Please see the [Land Cover Map 2015 Documentation (PDF)](href="https://www.ceh.ac.uk/sites/default/files/LCM2015_Dataset_Documentation.pdf) for methods.
  [The International Biodiversity Assessment Tool (IBAT)] reports international data for this indicator. UK-level data can be found in the Country Profiles, with further information included on Protected Area designation types, and IUCN management categories. To view these you will need to
  create a log in but this is free to do. Please note that the figures we present here differ slightly, because we include an extra set of Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs), namely Important Plant Areas. IBAT gives the option to view individula KBAs and Protected Areas on a map - by clicking
  on KBAs, and then on the name of the area the user is given more information on why it is classed as a KBA and the species present. By clicking on Protected Areas, and then on the name of the area, the user is taken to the individual area on [Protected
  Planet](https://www.protectedplanet.net/en/search-areas?geo_type=site). To use the map go to [Data Map](https://www.ibat-alliance.org/visual-data-map) and make selections in Apply Layers.  
   Data follows the UN specification for this indicator. This indicator has not been identified in
  collaboration with topic experts.
